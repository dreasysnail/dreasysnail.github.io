I am a Research scientist at [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/NLP/), primarily working on Natural Language Generation (NLG), Deep Generative Models (DGMs), Generative Pre-training and Text Representation learning. I received Ph.D. degree and M.S. degree (Statistical Science) from Duke University in 2018, advised by Professor [Lawrence Carin](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/). Before that, I received B.Sc. degree in Physics from Nanjin University, Department for Intensive Instruction ([DII](http://dii.nju.edu.cn/kuangym/?lang=en)), Kuang Yaming Honors school in 2011.

I have served as an area chair (AC) for NeurIPS (2021) and ACL (2021), as a senior program committee (SPC) for AAAI (2019-2021). I have served as one of the organization committee members in ACL (2020). I received NeurIPS top reviewer awards (2019). 

***Please send me an [email](mailto:yizhe.zhang@hotmail.com) with your latest CV if you are a senior PhD student working on natural language generation and looking for an internship***

My recent research focuses on below topics:

- Open-domain question answering

- Hallucination detection and prevention for NLG. 

- Efficient transformer

- Non-autoregressive text generation.

- Adversarial attacking for NLP. 

- Controllable text generation.

- Long-form text understanding/generation/reasoning.
