I am a staff Research scientist at [Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com), primarily working on Natural language processing and Machine Learning. Before joining Apple, I have been at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/NLP/) and  [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-processing/), working on natural language generation and NLP pre-training. 

I received Ph.D. degree and M.S. degree from [Duke University](https://gradschool.duke.edu). Before that, I received B.Sc. degree in Physics from [Nanjing University](http://dii.nju.edu.cn/kuangym/?lang=en), Kuang Yaming Honors school, in 2011.

I have served as Area Chairs (or SPC) for ICLR (2023-2024), ICML(2022-2024), NeurIPS (2019-2024), ACL (2020-2021), EMNLP (2022), NAACL (2023) and AAAI (2018-2021). I am serving as an Action Editor for Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR, since 2023) and ACL rolling review (ARR, since 2023).
I have served as one of the organization committee members in ACL (2020). I received NeurIPS top reviewer award (2018).
