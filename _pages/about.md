I am a Research scientist at [Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com), primarily working on Natural language processing and Machine Learning. Before joining Apple, I have been at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/NLP/) and  [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-processing/), working on natural language generation and NLP pre-training. 

I received Ph.D. degree and M.S. degree from Duke University. Before that, I received B.Sc. degree in Physics from Nanjing University, [Kuang Yaming Honors school](http://dii.nju.edu.cn/kuangym/?lang=en), in 2011.

I have served as Area Chairs (or SPC) for ICML(2022-2023), NeurIPS (2019-2023), ACL (2020-2021), EMNLP(2022) and AAAI (2018-2021). I am serving as an Action Editor for Transactions on Machine Learning Research.
I have served as one of the organization committee members in ACL (2020). I received NeurIPS top reviewer awards (2019).
