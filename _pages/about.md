I am a Research scientist at [Apple MLR](https://machinelearning.apple.com), primarily working on Natural language processing and Machine Learning. Before joining Apple, I have been at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/NLP/) and  [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-processing/), working on text generation and pre-training. 

I received Ph.D. degree and M.S. degree from Duke University. Before that, I received B.Sc. degree in Physics from Nanjing University, Kuang Yaming Honors school ([DII](http://dii.nju.edu.cn/kuangym/?lang=en)), in 2011.

I have served as an Area Chair (or SPC) for NeurIPS, ACL, EMNLP and AAAI. I have served as one of the organization committee members in ACL (2020). I received NeurIPS top reviewer awards (2019). 

***Please send me an [email](mailto:yizhe.zhang@hotmail.com) with your latest CV if you are a senior PhD student working on NLG and looking for an internship***

My recent research focuses on below topics:

- Efficient sequence models.

- Memory-augmented models.

- Controllable text geneneration.

- Safe & Responsible NLP. 

- Non-autoregressive generation.

- Multimodal pretraining.
