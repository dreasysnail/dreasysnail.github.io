I am a Research scientist at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/NLP/), primarily working on efficient NLP models for language generation and QA. Before joining Meta, I was at [Microsoft Research NLP group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-processing/), working on text generation and pre-training. 

I received Ph.D. degree and M.S. degree (Statistical Science) from Duke University in 2018, advised by Professor [Lawrence Carin](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/). Before that, I received B.Sc. degree in Physics from Nanjing University, Department for Intensive Instruction ([DII](http://dii.nju.edu.cn/kuangym/?lang=en)), Kuang Yaming Honors school in 2011.

I have served as an Area Chair (or equivalent) for NeurIPS (2021), ACL (2021) and AAAI (2019-2021). I have served as one of the organization committee members in ACL (2020). I received NeurIPS top reviewer awards (2019).

My recent research focuses on below topics:

- Efficient NLP models.

- Open-domain question answering.

- Controllable text geneneration.

- Safe & Responsible NLP. 

- Non-autoregressive generation.

- NLP Pretraining.
